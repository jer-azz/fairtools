## Welcome to FAIR tools

FAIR tools is an attempt at keeping track of the large and varied ecosystem of tools supporting the implementation [FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)

This list will initally be managed by myself, Jeremy Azzopardi ( https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0584-5729), but I hope to add functionality for user contributions and updates.
